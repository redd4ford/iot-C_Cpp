# laboratory-works-C-Cpp-2019
this is a repo for all laboratory works I coded on C/C++ as a part of my education process at LPNU IoT 1st course.

### lab 1 : first program
> create a console program that calculates the expression: *z^6 + 13z^4 + 7z^3 + 14z^2 - 2z + 21*, *z = 9.761*

### lab 2 : cycles and ifs
> a. create a program that tabulates the functions sequentially, and is selected depending on the value of the argument, in the interval *[a, b]* with a tab step *h*. function *cosec(e^x)*: when *x < 2*; function *sec(ln(x))*: when 2 <= x < 3; function *sin(ln(x))*: when x >= 3; tab step *h = 0.2*; interval *[a,b] = [1.5, 3.5]*.
> b. create a program that tabulates the function represented by a row at an interval *[a, b]* with a tab step *h* and an absolute error *d*. evaluate the error by the value of the next row member module.

### lab 3 : arrays and functions usage
> sort the rectangular matrix *A = {aij}* by *exchanging*. arrange the elements of the rows of the matrix as their values decrease. find the value of the function *f* that counts the sum of the elements in each column above the main diagonal of the matrix. find the value of the function *F* that calculates the product of *f* for the sorted matrix. enter matrix elements from the keyboard. the program should display a sorted matrix, all *fi(aij)* values and *F(fi(aij))* values.

### lab 4 : classes usage
> create a class *Helicopter* with 3 private, 2 public, and 2 protected fields. add a default constructor, and a constructor that initializes private and protected fields. add a default destructor. initialize 3 class objects and output their fields in main method.

### lab 5 : overloading and friend functions
> sort the rectangular matrix *A = {aij}* by *merging*. arrange the elements of the rows of the matrix as their values increase. find the value of the function *f* that calculates the arithmetic mean of the elements in each column under the main diagonal of the matrix. find the value of the function *F* the product of *f* for the sorted matrix. enter matrix elements from the keyboard. the program should display a sorted matrix, all *fi(aij)* values and *F(fi(aij))* values. use the one-dimensional array class, member functions, and friendly functions to solve the problem.

### lab 6 : operations overloading
> implement a class *Ellipse* with the methods for calcualting the area and the perimeter. overload operations *==*, *<*, *>*, *<<*, *>>*, as well as friendly operation **=*. the constructor must allow for simplified initialization of the *circle*.

### lab 7 : inheritance
> develop a class hierarchy of electronics devices: analog, digital, pulse, operational amplifier, current source, voltage source, decoder binary-decimal, binary adder. use abstract classes and virtual functions as needed. write a program that uses objects of created class types.

### lab 8 : abstract data structures usage
> develop an object-oriented C++ program that controls the data structure *Book* (a binary tree). typical operations: entering a node by a book title; deletion of all books by a given author; output of all books of the specified publishing house.
